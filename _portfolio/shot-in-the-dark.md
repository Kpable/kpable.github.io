Hired on as a contractor to implement some game systems and performance analysis, I stayed on to foresee the implementation of the Steam API and subsequent build generation and Steam Platform configuration. 

Shortly afterwards my partner and I co-founded Possum House Games as a platform for releasing Shot in the Dark and our past and future works.
