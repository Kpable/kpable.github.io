Started as a side project (because you can never have too many of those) to test out a series of mechanics, tools, workflows, and pipelines. 

We envisioned this to be a small side challenge in a larger world, isolated down to a single replayable experience. A challenge akin to the eagle towers in Assassins Creed or the Sheikah towers in Breath of the wild. But instead of overcoming the challenge of climbing a tower to reveal a part of a map, the intention here is toc appease spirits in a ghost ridden convinience store, charging your supernatural abilities for use elsewhere in a larger world. 

In this case the spirits want you to complete a shopping list. 

This game is still in active development with a remote team of 4 working part time where I manage the team, planning, meetings, and task tracking. As well as development support.
