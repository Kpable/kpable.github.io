I've gotten the opportunity to work on new mechanics and systems I have never worked on before at a scale I have not seen before in any of my previous games. I've also got to see and help the game grow and evolve over the years from before it entered early access and its many updates thereafter, few of which I was responsible for the marquee feature of the update. No pressure right.
