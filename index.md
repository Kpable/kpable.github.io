  - excerpt: |
        Hey there! I'm a game developer with a strong **9+ year software engineering** background. Recently a **Gameplay Engineer** at Fire Hose Games working on [Techtonica](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1457320/Techtonica/) gaining experience as a versatile **generalist** specializing in **developing** and **optimizing** core **gameplay mechanics**, game **features**, and **development tools**. 

        Prior to that, I co-founded [Possum House Games](https://possumhousegames.com/) tackling **production**, **programming**, **business development**, **marketing** and other miscellaneous logistics as I **taught myself many aspects of game development** over the years. 
        
        Though there are still many game dev technologies, techniques and topics I want to explore, below is the latest title I've worked on and topics I've had the opportunity to deep dive into during development!
