  - excerpt: |
        Hey there! I'm a game developer with a strong **9+ year software engineering** background. Recently a **Gameplay Engineer** at Fire Hose Games working on [Techtonica](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1457320/Techtonica/) gaining experience as a versatile **generalist** specializing in **developing** and **optimizing** core **gameplay mechanics**, game **features**, and **development tools**. 

        Prior to that, I co-founded [Possum House Games](https://possumhousegames.com/) tackling **production**, **programming**, **business development**, **marketing** and other miscellaneous logistics as I **taught myself many aspects of game development** over the years. 
        
        Though there are still many game dev technologies, techniques and topics I want to explore, below is the latest title I've worked on and topics I've had the opportunity to deep dive into during development!

  - title: "Machine Functionality"
    # excerpt: | 
    #   Can't have a factory without the machines to run it. I created and supported multiple machines to ensure proper flow of various types of automation pipelines. 
      
    #   I did wonder what it would be like to build and fix machines for a living. Surely this comes close to the real thing.
    # image_path: /assets/images/techtonica/lima.jpg

  - title: "Player Equipment"
    # excerpt: | 
    #  The player uses a variety of equipment for exploring and nagivating the world. Either adding functionality to some or taking new ones through rapid protyping to full implentation. 

    #   The Omniseeker in particular was a fun one, after all, a tool that find any type of object anywhere in a voxel world regardless of whether the target has been streamed in or not, not a tall ask right... not at all.

  - title: "FMOD Audio Integration"
    # excerpt: | 
    #   So there I was first week as a new hire and asked to covert the entirety of the game's audio to use FMOD, having never used it before. Well fortunately I'm a fast learner and I got it done in a week. 
      
    #   I went on to continute to support various audio intergration features and improvements throughout the course of developement working with the audio team.

  - title: "Building and Snapping"
    # excerpt: "Key to the Base Building update, I worked with design to create a snapping and placement system that would be intuitive for the player and enable flexibility for designers to change rules for how various types of building pieces would interact with eachother based on a number of potential player contexts."

    # excerpt: "A small, cute game about responsibility and making tough choices. You maintain a flock of sheep and decide how you spend your day's earnings. Feed the family, yourself, or buy more sheep. Tough choices."

    # alt: "shot-in-the-dark"

  - title: "Menus and HUD"
    # excerpt: "Techtonica has A LOT of information to display to the player and the UI delivered through various gameplay, narrative, and machine menus. I prototyped some and integrated others from artist made mockups."

  - title: "Conveyor Belts"
    # excerpt: "Core to the automation genre, I contributed a large part to the ease of placement and automatic conversion of belt type while the player drags and places belts however they like. Resources have places to be after all."

  - title: "Multiplayer"
    # excerpt: "As a multiplayer game, many of the game's mechanics and systems needed to support proper netowrk messaging and syncing to ensure that all players got the full experience."

After spending a year deep diving into development pipelines, game production, and other independent studio responsibilities I decided that I would prefer focusing my skills on my programming efforts rather than running an entire studio. That’s when I joined Fire Hose Games as a generalist gameplay engineer working on Techtonica for 3 years through early access and release.

While I was working full time as a embedded hardware engineer, my passion for learning game development I was hired on as a contractor for the late stage development of the game to hlep bring it to release.

After joining the local game development community, I found myself at my first collaborative game jam where I found a team I would go on to work with throughout the next few years. Heavy is the Crown is the game we made in 48 hours.
