Hey, I like to program stuff in games. I'm a Software Engineer by day doing game development as a hobby during nearly all my free nights and weekends.  I've been doing both for 2+ years and I've been programming for about 6+ years now. I got into game dev because frankly it's just fun. I have fun playing games and making games, even if the latter comes with struggle, frustration, stressâ€¦  so does the former depending on the game. In either case I love it all and want to continue being part of the chaos that leads to the creation of something incredible.

- My time in the project 
   - This is the first team project I participated in. I came in as the programmer while the team was still forming. There was a bit of code around for concept testing which I was quickly told to feel free to overwrite anything. I didn't, I mean it worked why redo it. Instead I expanded it as needed with the changes to the rest of the game.
