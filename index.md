intro: 
  - excerpt: |
        I'm a **game developer** with a strong **9+ year software engineering** background.
        Currently full time at Fire Hose Games working on [Techtonica](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1457320/Techtonica/). 
        I also co-founded [Possum House Games](https://possumhousegames.com/) handling all things logistics. 
        
        While I've worn many hats as a game dev, my interests and strengths lie as a **generalist programmer**, primarily in implementing **gameplay systems and mechanics**.
        
        Below are some of the titles I've worked on!

    title: "Space Cat 9"
    excerpt: "First time working on a platformer with a highly mobile player. Can confirm, it's hard to get that feel right. Though I think having the main protagonist be a cat fighting a host of mice in their machines aboard a procedurally generated spaceship kind of makes it better."

    title: "Shot in the Dark"
    excerpt: "A unique and interesting combination of genres and use of only 3 colors. This game only gets harder with each new level. My first deep dive into the Construct 3 game engine. Found it pretty cool though getting Construct 3 to play nice with Steam was a bit of a hassle. Hope to port this bad boy to Unity someday."

  - title: "Machine Functionality"
    # excerpt: | 
    #   Can't have a factory without the machines to run it. I created and supported multiple machines to ensure proper flow of various types of automation pipelines. 
      
    #   I did wonder what it would be like to build and fix machines for a living. Surely this comes close to the real thing.

  - title: "Player Equipment"
    # excerpt: | 
    #   The player uses a variety of equipment for exploring and navigating the world. Either adding functionality to some or taking new ones through rapid prototyping to full implementation

    #   The Omniseeker in particular was a fun one, after all, a tool that finds any type of object anywhere in a voxel world regardless of whether the target has been streamed in or not, not a tall ask right... not at all.

  - title: "FMOD Audio Integration"
    # excerpt: | 
    #   So there I was for the first week as a new hire and asked to convert the entirety of the game's audio to use FMOD, having never used it before. Well fortunately I'm a fast learner and I got it done in a week. 
      
    #   I went on to continue to support various audio integration features and improvements throughout the course of development working with the audio team.

  - title: "Building and Snapping"
    # excerpt: "Key to the Base Building update, I worked with design to create a snapping and placement system that would be intuitive for the player and enable flexibility for designers to change rules for how various types of building pieces would interact with each other based on a number of potential player contexts."

  - title: "Menus and HUD"
    # excerpt: "Techtonica has A LOT of information to display to the player and the UI delivered through various gameplay, narrative, and machine menus. I prototyped some and integrated others from artist made mockups."
