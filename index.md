        I'm a game developer with a strong software engineering background. Currently I'm co-founder [Possum House Games](https://possumhousegames.com/) acting as the producer, programmer, and handler of all things logistics. While I've worn many hats as a game dev, my interests and strengths lie primarily in designing and implementing gameplay systems. 
        
        Below are some of my latest works!

    title: "Space Cat 9"
    excerpt: "First time working on a platformer with a highly mobile player. Can confirm, it's hard to get that feel right. Though I think having the main protagonist be a cat fighting a host of mice in their machines aboard a procedurally generated spaceship kind of makes it better."

Found it pretty cool though getting Construct 3 to play nice with Steam was a bit of a hassle. Hope to port this bad boy to Unity someday."
