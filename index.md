intro: 
  - excerpt: |
        I'm a **game developer** with a strong **9+ year software engineering** background.
        Currently full time at Fire Hose Games working on [Techtonica](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1457320/Techtonica/). 
        I also co-founded [Possum House Games](https://possumhousegames.com/) handling all things logistics. 
        
        While I've worn many hats as a game dev, my interests and strengths lie as a **generalist programmer**, primarily in implementing **gameplay systems and mechanics**.
        
        Below is the latest title I've worked on!

Found it pretty cool though getting Construct 3 to play nice with Steam was a bit of a hassle. Hope to port this bad boy to Unity someday."

After spending a year deep diving into development pipelines, game production, and other independent studio responsibilities I decided that I would prefer focusing my skills on my programming efforts rather than running an entire studio. Thatâ€™s when I joined Fire Hose Games as a generalist gameplay engineer working on Techtonica for 3 years through early access and release.

While I was working full time as a embedded hardware engineer, my passion for learning game development I was hired on as a contractor for the late stage development of the game to hlep bring it to release.

After joining the local game development community, I found myself at my first collaborative game jam where I found a team I would go on to work with throughout the next few years. Heavy is the Crown is the game we made in 48 hours.
