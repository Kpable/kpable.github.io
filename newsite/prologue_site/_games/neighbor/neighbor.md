## What I Did

For the initial prototype made in Unity, I made a mini game in which cats run around and you have to select the correct one as described by one of the neighbors. When the team picked the project back up and moved to Godot, I worked as a Lead Programmer on the team, generating system level design for integration. It was tough, but new and fun.
