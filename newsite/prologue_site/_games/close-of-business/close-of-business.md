## What I Did 

Some of the members I worked with on a previous project ([Artificial Infiltration]) wanted to continue working on games together and since I like doing that, I continued my work with them. I was the Lead Programmer for this game as well but with a smaller team I found myself working more with the designer on the design of the game and how best to implement functionality.
