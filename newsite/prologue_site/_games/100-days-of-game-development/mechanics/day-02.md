### Day 2: Spaceship Behavior
#### June 25, 2018 

**Today's Focus**: Spaceship behavior

**Details**:
  - Taking a look at the mechanics around 2D spaceship behaviors
  - Looked at implementation without using the RigidBody2D component
  - Looked at implementation using the RigidBody2D component
  - Still curious about implementation without the built in physics, but went with the built in physics for now. 

**Thoughts** 

So that shmup I mentioned yesterday, [Ludem Dare 41](https://github.com/Kpable/Dimensional-Rift-Escape), I threw together some quick and dirty ship movement modified from some tutorial that I had seen some time ago. It's for this reason, and the fact that I have an outstanding task from Jan. 2016 to complete a 10 game beginner developer challenge which including cloning asteroids, is why I'm taking a closer look at this.
