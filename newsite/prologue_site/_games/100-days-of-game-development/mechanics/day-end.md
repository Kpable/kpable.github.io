### Day ?: 
#### August 2, 2018 

End. 

So I failed to keep at this consistently. I found it hard to carve out a half hour to an hour a day to focus on my own game dev. I did try to complete this challenge while working on a seperate game with a few friends. My game dev time went towards that project more than it did my pursuit of my topics of interests. 

**Lessons Learned** 

I needed to find an alternative way to determine progress on a particular subject. During this run I only considered the topic covered once it was fully implemented, tested, and presentable. I feel that was a mistake and deviated from my initial challenge. I mistook my goal to **work towards** understanding and playing around with a particular topic each day for *completely understand* a topic of interest each day. Huge mistake. I forgot the whole point of me doing this was to learn about the topics I grew curious about over the years. Once it became about needing something completed presentable after 30 minutes to an hour, it started to feel impossible, then the days started to pile up as I worked though bugs and other issues. I need a new perspective on what I deem as "presentable". 

**So what next**

I failed this challenge and it was a blow. I've taken on a number of game dev challenges of the majoritory ended in failure and the weight of those failures do pile on after a while. As discouraging as those failures are, I really enjoy game dev. So I will continue. This is only Round 1 of the 100 days of dev challenge. There's still plenty more I am curious about. So I will regroup, get organized, ease up on myself, rethink some things and carry on. 

See you in Round 2!
