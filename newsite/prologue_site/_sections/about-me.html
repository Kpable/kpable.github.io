  My name is Lesther and I like to program content in games. I'm a Software Engineer by day doing game development as a hobby during nearly all my free nights and weekends. I've been doing both for 4+ years and I've been programming for about 7+ years now. I got into game dev because frankly it's just fun. I have fun playing games and making games, even if the latter comes with struggle, frustration, stressâ€¦ so does the former depending on the game and/or my skill level. In either case I love it all and want to continue being part of the chaos that leads to the creation of something incredible.
