Hey, I like to program content in games. I'm a Software Engineer by day doing game development as a hobby during nearly all my free nights and weekends.  I've been doing both for 2+ years and I've been programming for about 6+ years now. I got into game dev because frankly it's just fun. I have fun playing games and making games, even if the latter comes with struggle, frustration, stressâ€¦  so does the former depending on the game. In either case I love it all and want to continue being part of the chaos that leads to the creation of something incredible.
