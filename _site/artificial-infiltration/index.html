<p>In Artificial Infiltration you navigate maze towers in 2.5D fashion, collecting keys, unlocking doors, and taking teleporters as needed to reach the top.</p>

<!-- My role on this project -->
<h3 id="what-i-did">What I did</h3>

<p>My role on the team was Lead Programmer (although in the game I call myself the “Code Manipulator”) in which my duties included, but weren’t limited to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Code design and implementation</li>
  <li>Code debugging and maintenance</li>
  <li>UI technical design and implementation</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-this-game-came-to-be">How this game came to be</h3>

<p>I wanted to find a team to work with so I signed up at IndieTeamUp back when it was running. Soon enough I found a team, interests aligned, passions converged and our small team of 7 made this happen. We were pushing towards getting the game through Steam Greenlight shortly before Greenlight was discontinued and the game was released under Assertive Games on Itch.io and IndieGameStand. In a few short months we got the game together, expanding the team as needs in an area became apparent.</p>

<p>Upon player reaching a corner of the tower, gameplay focus shifts to that side of the tower.</p>

<h4 id="development-considerations">Development Considerations</h4>
<p>With the designed player control for this 2.5D platformer being left, right, and jump, I considered how to both maintain that control constant and maintain view of the play space as the playing field shifted planes in 3D space.</p>

		  	<h4 id="design-challenge">Design Challenge</h4>

<p>Create a teleporter that will teleport the player to a destination location. That location can be any edge on the current tower or any edge on another tower.</p>

<h4 id="development-considerations">Development Considerations</h4>

<p>The destination will need to have an edge associated with it and that edge will have to be identified through the destination’s position in the world. The edge will belong to a tower anywhere in the world which would make the destination’s position should relate to the tower, which given the tower’s origin and size would give the information on the tower’s four edges.</p>

<p>Create menus allowing creation and deletion of game save data, game setting modification, and game mode selection.</p>

<h4 id="development-considerations">Development Considerations</h4>

<p>Need to establish a bidirectional link between UI elements, saved data, and current game data. Changes in game data should both be saved and applied, as well as reflected in the UI when the change occurs.</p>

<p>Pause the game to allow the player to either change settings, restart, or quit.</p>

<h4 id="development-considerations">Development Considerations</h4>

<p>Stopping time would be quickest but that creates challenges for any time-based actions such as menu animation. Also changes to the settings mid game will need to be applied to the current level.</p>

<p>The force applied will have to be applied to any object that enters the trigger, not just the last one. That force will have to be continuous unless a single shot burst is desired.</p>
