<!-- Description -->
In Artificial Infiltration you navigate maze towers in 2.5D fashion, collecting keys, unlocking doors, and taking teleporters as needed to reach the top.

### What I did

My role on the team was Lead Programmer (although in the game I call myself the "Code Manipulator") in which my duties included, but weren't limited to:
- Code design and implementation
- Code debugging and maintenance 
- UI technical design and implementation

And soâ€¦. I did the things.

<!-- In Artificial Infiltration, you play as A.D.A. (Artificial Defense Assistant), an AI tasked with the infiltration of enemy systems, the complexity of which are circumnavigated by instantiating both A.D.A. and the entire system in a virtualized environment. You take control of the virtualized instance of A.D.A. and guide her through the enemy system, finding successful infiltration awaiting somewhere in the maze. -->

### How this game came to be

I wanted to find a team to work with so I signed up at IndieTeamUp back when it was running. Soon enough I found a team, interests aligned, passions converged and our small team of 7 made this happen. We were pushing towards getting the game through Steam Greenlight shortly before Greenlight was discontinued and the game was released under Assertive Games on Itch.io and IndieGameStand. In a few short months we got the game together, expanding the team as needs in an area became apparent.
