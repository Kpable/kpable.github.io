### What I did

My role on the team was Lead Programmer (although in the game I call myself the "Code Manipulator") in which my duties included, but weren't limited to:
- Code design and implementation
- Code debugging and maintenance 
- UI technical design and implementation

### How this game came to be

I wanted to find a team to work with so I signed up at IndieTeamUp back when it was running. Soon enough I found a team, interests aligned, passions converged and our small team of 7 made this happen. We were pushing towards getting the game through Steam Greenlight shortly before Greenlight was discontinued and the game was released under Assertive Games on Itch.io and IndieGameStand. In a few short months we got the game together, expanding the team as needs in an area became apparent.
