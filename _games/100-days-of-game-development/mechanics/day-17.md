### Day 17: Steering Behavior - Obstacle Avoidance 
#### July 10, 2018 

**Today's Focus**: Steering Behaviors - Obstacle Avoidance

**Details**:
  - Implemented basic obstacle avoidance
  - only implemeted in 2D. 

**Thoughts** 
Still working with [Programming Game AI by Example](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Example-Wordware-Developers-Library/dp/1556220782) for this one and although the concepts make sense, Implmenting them in unity from a c++ system the book describes is proving interesting as there are already helper functions to accomplish the tasks the book performs. I appreciate the long way approach though, good to know what all thoses helpers are doing.
