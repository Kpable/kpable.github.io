### Day 9: Shmup Power Ups
#### July 2, 2018 

**Today's Focus**: Shmup Power Ups  

**Details**:
  - Incorporated power up 
  - Change weapons when the ship collides with it. 

**Thoughts** These are a must of any given shmup. I had to incorporate a power-up to allow the ship to change weapons. Next step for this would be to be able to set a power-ups type so that enemies can spawn power-ups on death.
