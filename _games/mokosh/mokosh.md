## What I Did

With enough programmers on the team I bravely stepped forth to pursue a non programming interest, yet still game development related, in **Pixel Art!**

Thats right! I did a lot of pixel art (maybe wrote one or two lines of code here or there, what can I say, couldn't resist). I also oversaw the integration effort, managing branches and making sure merges happened without too much trouble. 

Using Aesprite, a tool I have wanted to get familiar with for quite some time, I drew up the tiles for the maps and some miscellaneous items, like clouds, rocks, leaves. 

(I did not create the character, she's cool though.)
