  A 2D-style narrative game that emphasizes the delicate nature of showing kindness to the people around you. The gameâ€™s story revolves around a main character who just wants to go home and rest after a long work day. As he climbs up to his top floor apartment he encounters other residents in the building. With each encounter theres a choice to get to know them and help them when they seek assistance. However, trying to help too many people could have adverse effects.
