## What I Did

I implemented some Shmup mechanics. Tried to implement some escape room puzzles. This was my second Ludem Dare and I tried to learn from my previous ambitions goals and better scope what I was trying to do. Little did I know that escape room and puzzle design in general requires a bit more time to get right and further implement than the time alloted over a weekend.
