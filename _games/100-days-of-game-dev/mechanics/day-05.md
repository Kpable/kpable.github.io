### Day 5: Health and Destroying Objects
#### June 28, 2018 

**Today's Focus**: Health and Destroying objects

**Details**:
  - Stopped projectiles from colliding with each other 
  - Processed projectiles impacting another object with health
  - Reduced that object's health by damage dealt by projectile
  - Destroy the object when health reaches zero

**Thoughts** 

Kinda cheated a bit here since health is something I've coded and used before so not a new thing to look at but I'm doing this to see how these different shmup components need to interact with one another so I went with it. The more I use it, the more I get to find areas of improvement for it. This is all leading to something..
