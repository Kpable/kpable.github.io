### Day 1: Object Pooling 

#### June 24, 2018 

**Today's Focus**: Learn and implement object pooling.

**Details**:
  - Went through brackeys tutorial on [Object Pooling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdSmKaJvCoA).
  - Looking at other resources to see other implementations to improve usability. 
  - Did a little clean up in the hierarchy to make pools manageable

**Thoughts** 

I've always been curious, never really had a need to implement them. I worked on a shmup for a [Ludem Dare 41](https://github.com/Kpable/Dimensional-Rift-Escape) and I think this would be good to implement in that for when I continue work on it. All those bullets flying around. Plus I think I recall back when I played a MegaMan game, where I could only shoot 3-4 bullets before the first bullet I shot vanished to be the new bullet I fired.
