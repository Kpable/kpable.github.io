### Day 14: Steering Behaviors - Flee
#### July 7, 2018 

**Today's Focus**: Steering Behaviors - Flee

**Details**:
  - Implemented Flee 
  - Played a bit with Weighting the steering force

**Thoughts** 
My initial thought was that the Flee behavior is just Seek in the opposite direction and to an extent that is true. But continuing to use [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hA7G3gup-4) as a refence, additional possibilities for the behaviors came to my attention such as only fleeing if target is within a certain range and applying a weight to a calculated steering force to alter its effect disctinctly from the other behaviors. Also brings to mind the possiblity of maintaining a list of behaviors the steering would process with a given type, target, and weight. Oh the possibilities..
