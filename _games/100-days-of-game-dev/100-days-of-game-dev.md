  A personal challenge to have an organized fun way of nagivating through my game development curiousities. I set out to collect myself and go through my ever growing list of game development interests one at a time. Each day I made some progress towards investigating a subject of interest. Doing some work to study or implement a quick idea.

## How this project came to be

I found other members of the online community discussing their successes with the [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/_100DaysOfCode) and how much they learned through the experience. I sought to do something similar but tailored to my game development curiousities. Which is a lot.
