After graduating with a degree in Computer Science and Computer Engineering with a minor in Mathematics, I went on to work professionally as a Software Engineer for 9+ years. Through that experience I learned such topics such as:

`software architecting` `feature design` `system design` `UML` `documentation` `requirements defining` `Jira` `task tracking` `project management` `interdisciplinary collaboration` `agile methodology` `scrum` `test driven development` `unit testing` `automated testing` `version control` `SVN` `Git` `programming languages` `C++` `C` `Python` `C#` `hardware constraints` `risk analysis and assessment` `memory management` `debugging` `coding standards`

During the first half of my career, I began independently studying game development part time working with Unity3D and C#, getting involved with my local community where I’ve had the opportunity to speak in workshops and as a panelist during the annual game festival.

I also co-founded [Possum House Games](https://possumhousegames.com/), an independent game studio, where I continued to develop games and my skills as a game developer. Working in small teams has led to wearing many hats, providing me the chance to learn and explore the following topics:

`Game Engines` `Unity` `Construct 3` `Unreal` `Godot` `Pico 8` `GB Studio` `Third Party Platforms` `Steam` `Itch.io` `UI development` `remote collaboration` `game design` `level design` `system design` `story telling` `game production` `scheduling` `marketing` `PR` `game AI` `state machines` `cutscenes` `dialogue` `platformers` `first person experiences` `procedural generation` `C#` `development tools` `Blender` `Aseprite` `Gimp` `Sprytile`

A few years later I joined Fire Hose Games as a Gameplay Engineer contributing to  the development of [Techtonica](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1457320/Techtonica/), a first person factory automation game set in an underground voxel world, through early access launch on Steam and Xbox, all the way through multiple updates and finally shipping the full game on those platforms and PS5. 

Though I’ve learned a lot so far there are still many more topics I want to and continue to explore:

`console development` `Nintendo Switch development`  `procedural generation` `hierarchical state machines` `third person game play` `narrative writing` `pixel art` `post processing` `3D environments`
