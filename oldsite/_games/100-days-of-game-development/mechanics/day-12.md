### Day 12: Steering Behaviors - Seek
#### July 5, 2018 

**Today's Focus**: Steering Behaviors - Seek

**Details**:
  - Created a Vehicle object
  - Applied Seek Behavior
  - Made Space Invader for fun

**Thoughts** 
AI is a big interest to me but I have yet to really dive into learning some concepts. Steering Behaviors are a good place to start I think. A lot of this i've looked at briefly in the past and even created a Unity implementation of the code written in [Programming Game AI by Example](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Example-Wordware-Developers-Library/dp/1556220782). I never fully got a grasp of all of the concept and eventually moved on to other topics of interest but this is something (like everything that I've previously committed to) that I don't want to give up on. This will be a good way to take a real good look at these behaviors and learn what's going on with them. I'm using [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hA7G3gup-4) as reference as well.
