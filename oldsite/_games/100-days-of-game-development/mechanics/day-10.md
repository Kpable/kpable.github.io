### Day 10: Weapon Redux - Spiral Guns
#### July 3, 2018 

**Today's Focus**: Weapon Redux - Spiral Guns

**Details**:
  - Looked into how to spawn guns around the ship
  - Had some fun with angles

**Thoughts** 
I was having some issues with getting the projectiles to spawn from different gun locations. I also wanted to upgrade it from manually defined positions (which I would like but not right now) to just around the ship depending on the number. Right now I was only thinking with regard to single shot and triple shot but the possibilities...
