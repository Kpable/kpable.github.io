### Day 11: Bullet Reflection
#### July 4, 2018 

**Today's Focus**: Bullet Reflection

**Details**:
  - Reflect bullets of surfaces
  - Set Fixed reflection for now

**Thoughts** 
There was this Dexter's Laser Lab flash game many years ago I had a blast with (ha! laser blast! punSkills++;). It was a puzzle game where you had orient some mirrors so that when the laser fired it would hit all the balloons in the level. It was fun and I have seen that mechanic show up again in other games as well. Such as Zeldas in which a dungeon required the reflection of light, most recently in Song of the Deep in which some reflective shells needed to be rotated to trigger doors or switches. I wanted to look at how that could be incorporated. For now though, i got some fixed reflection going so that bullets will bounce in the direction the reflective object states. Next step, doing it dynamically with raycasts and line renderer.
