### Day 7: Weapons refactoring
#### June 30 2018 

**Today's Focus**: Weapons refactoring

**Details**:
  - Changed the origin of projectiles to around the ship

**Thoughts** 

Wanted to refactor how the weapons work. Previously the I imported it from a tutorial but I want to add some more versatility. The plan is to have the gun objects circle around the ship depending on the weapon type.
