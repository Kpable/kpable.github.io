### Day 8: Parallax Backgrounds
#### July 1, 2018 

**Today's Focus**: Parallax Backgrounds

**Details**:
  - Modified parallax implementation from a tutorial to work
  - Stardust and stars move with respect to target object, in this case a ship. 

**Thoughts** 
I completed a tutorial a while back that incorporated a parallax effect. I had to massage it a bit to get it to work right but it looks good. Theres still some work left to do to get it to work a bit nicer, but for the interim its a good start.
