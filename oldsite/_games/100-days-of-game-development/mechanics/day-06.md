### Day 6: Splitter Behavior (Environmental Hazard)
#### June 29, 2018 

**Today's Focus**: Splitter Behavior (Environmental Hazard)

**Details**:
  - Have meteor split into smaller copies of itself
  - Pass splitting information onto smaller copies. 
  - Pooled Meteors since splitting them makes a lot. 

**Thoughts** 

So I dub these kinds of behaviors environmental hazards because in looking at some common themes among platformers and some other types of games, there's often an enemy that when you do enough damage to kill it, it splits off into smaller weaker versions of itself that do the same thing until you've killed enough. Like the blob creatures from Ori and the Blind Forest, giant manta may from Super Mario Sunshine, Some Goombas in Mario, etc.  There are others I want to look at like crawlers, spine shooters (always shoot like 3-5 needles), droppers (hang from the ceiling until you pass under them) etc. This one is just currently applicable.
