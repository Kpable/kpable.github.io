  Ludem Dare 40 game jam entry with theme of "the more you have the worse it gets". A game in which you work as hard as you can to complete your tasks only to fall short of getting that promotion. Only choice is to sign up for more work to further prove yourself. More work means you have to work a bit harder to get the job done all in preparation for that performance review at the end of the month!

## What I Did

Somewhat inspired by Rick and Mortyâ€™s Virtual Rickality's Battery charging mini game. In the mini game you play a rapid response type game in which you have to respond to many different elements requiring attention in rapid succession. Because I had VR in mind, I though I'd take a shot at learning 3D modeling with Blender. Unfortunately, this being my first game jam ever I fear I may have set my sights too high for one weekend. Still had fun though.
